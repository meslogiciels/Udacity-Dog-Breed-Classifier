# Udacity-Dog-Breed-Classifier

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, one will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images.

Write an algorithm which given an image of a dog will identify an estimate of the canine's breed.  If the supplied image is of a human face, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
